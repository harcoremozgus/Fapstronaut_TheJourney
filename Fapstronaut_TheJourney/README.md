### Fapstronaut
A 2D endless runner to test the Godot Engine while parodying the pornography industry

### Author
https://github.com/harcoremozgus

### Version
0.5

### CONTROLS
W) Jump (double jump if "chad")
S) Slide
K) Kick

### Life 
There are two bars:
1) Urges: if it gets to the maximum value, 
you lose. It heals with time.
2) Brain fog: it reduces in every poster. 
Once you are chad it stops, no brain
fog is left (and no more upgrades).

### Posters and "Chad"
Every x time a poster appears, it affects: 
> Player: jump power, damage, slide time
> Enemies: spawn time, stats
In the 6th month, you become a chad.
You can now double jump.

### Enemies
> Social media: horizontal movement. Top, 
middle or bottom of the screen. They can 
come in pairs if you are a chad.
You can destroy the middle ones by kicking.
> Coomer: swings his arm.
> Twitch Thot: gets to you and you can't jump
or slide. Kick it various times to break free.
