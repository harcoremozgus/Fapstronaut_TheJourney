### Author

### Version
1.0.a

### CONTROLS
W) Jump (double jump if "chad")
S) Slide
A) and D) Horizontal movement (final boss only)
K) or SPACE) Kick

### Life 
There are two bars:
1) Urges: if it gets to the maximum value, 
you lose. It heals with time.
2) Brain fog: it reduces in every poster. 
Once you are chad it stops, no brain
fog is left (and no more upgrades).

### Posters and "Chad"
Every x time a poster appears, it affects: 
> Player: jump power, damage, slide time
> Enemies: spawn time, stats
In the 6th month, you become a chad.
You can now double jump.
